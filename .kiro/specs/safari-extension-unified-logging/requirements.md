# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a unified logging system for a Safari browser extension that combines frontend (ViteJS) and backend (Python) logging into a single log file. The system will capture logging events and exception details from both the browser extension frontend and Python backend, writing them to a centralized log file that can be monitored in real-time for development and debugging purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend and backend logs to be written to a single unified log file, so that I can monitor the entire application's behavior from one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Safari extension frontend generates a log event THEN the system SHALL send the log data to the Python backend asynchronously
2. WHEN log data is sent asynchronously THEN the system SHALL NOT block the frontend execution or user interface
3. WHEN the Python backend receives frontend log data THEN the system SHALL write it to the unified log file with appropriate formatting
4. WHEN the Python backend generates its own log events THEN the system SHALL write them directly to the same unified log file
5. WHEN log entries are written THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, log levels, and source identification (frontend vs backend)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want exception details from both frontend and backend to be captured in the unified log, so that I can debug issues across the entire application stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unhandled exception occurs in the Safari extension THEN the system SHALL capture the exception details and send them to the backend
2. WHEN an exception occurs in the Python backend THEN the system SHALL log the exception details to the unified log file
3. WHEN exception data is logged THEN the system SHALL include stack traces, error messages, and contextual information
4. WHEN exceptions are logged THEN the system SHALL clearly identify the source component (frontend/backend)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the unified log file in real-time using tail -f, so that I can see application events as they happen during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unified log file is created THEN the system SHALL ensure it is accessible for tail -f monitoring
2. WHEN log entries are written THEN the system SHALL flush the data immediately to ensure real-time visibility
3. WHEN using tail -f on the log file THEN the developer SHALL see new log entries appear in real-time
4. WHEN the log file grows large THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to prevent excessive disk usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging system to be easily configurable, so that I can adjust log levels and output formats based on my development needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the logging system THEN the developer SHALL be able to set different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
2. WHEN log levels are configured THEN the system SHALL only output logs at or above the specified level
3. WHEN configuring log format THEN the developer SHALL be able to customize the timestamp format and log entry structure
4. IF the logging system is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally without logging overhead

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Safari extension to communicate reliably with the Python backend for logging, so that no log events are lost during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Safari extension attempts to send log data THEN the system SHALL establish a reliable connection to the Python backend
2. IF the backend is temporarily unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL queue log events and retry sending them
3. WHEN log data is successfully sent to the backend THEN the system SHALL confirm receipt to prevent duplicate entries
4. IF log transmission fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide fallback logging to browser console with clear error indication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to track version information and log initial startup, so that I can identify which version of the extension is running and when it starts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension code is modified THEN the system SHALL increment the build number in the version (major.minor.build format)
2. WHEN the Safari extension initializes THEN the system SHALL log "Loading <extension name> <version>" as the first log entry
3. WHEN version information is included in logs THEN the system SHALL use the format major.minor.build
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN the initial loading message SHALL be sent to the unified logging system
