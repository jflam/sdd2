  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 10. Create integration tests and end-to-end validation
  - Write integration tests for frontend-to-backend log flow
  - Test exception handling across the entire stack
  - Validate unified log file contains both frontend and backend entries
  - Test async behavior doesn't block frontend operations
